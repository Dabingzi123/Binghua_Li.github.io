Currently I am working on the feature extraction of the turbulent flow by means of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). For DMD, the agglomeration strategies on spatial and temporal (clustering and optimal sampling) are applied to deal with large size of datasets. Composite sequences of snapshots with a new amplitude factor was introduced to find relevant modes. These techniques are applied to flapping airfoil wake flow and turbulent flow control problems. I am also working on the porous media reconstruction and multi-phase flow filtration simulation for industrial applications using reduced order modeling.
